# Below are all the sections and options you can have in ~/.streamlit/config.toml.
#[global]

# By default, Streamlit checks if the Python watchdog module is available and, if not, prints a warning asking for you to install it. The watchdog module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's ability to detect changes to files in your filesystem.
# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.
# Default: False
disableWatchdogWarning = False

# If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script via "python my_script.py".
# Default: True
showWarningOnDirectExecution = True

# DataFrame serialization.
# Acceptable values: - 'legacy': Serialize DataFrames using Streamlit's custom format. Slow but battle-tested. - 'arrow': Serialize DataFrames using Apache Arrow. Much faster and versatile.
# Default: "arrow"
dataFrameSerialization = "arrow"


[logger]

# Level of logging: 'error', 'warning', 'info', or 'debug'.
# Default: 'info'
level = "info"

# String format for logging messages. If logger.datetimeFormat is set, logger messages will default to `%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(message)s`. See [Python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.6/library/logging.html#formatter-objects) for available attributes.

caching = True

# If False, makes your Streamlit script not draw to a Streamlit app.
# Default: True
displayEnabled = True

# Controls whether uncaught app exceptions are displayed in the browser. By default, this is set to True and Streamlit displays app exceptions and associated tracebacks in the browser.
# If set to False, an exception will result in a generic message being shown in the browser, and exceptions and tracebacks will be printed to the console only.
# Default: True
showErrorDetails = True


[runner]

# Allows you to type a variable or string by itself in a single line of Python code to write it to the app.
# Default: True

# Install a Python tracer to allow you to stop or pause your script at any point and introspect it. As a side-effect, this slows down your script's execution.
# Default: False

# Sets the MPLBACKEND environment variable to Agg inside Streamlit to prevent Python crashing.
# Default: True
